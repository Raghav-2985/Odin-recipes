        <li><b>Instructions</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Prepare the Base:</b> In a saucepan, combine the tomatoes,
            cashews, ginger, garlic, whole spices, and 1 cup of water. Bring to
            a boil, then cover and simmer for 10 minutes until the tomatoes are
            soft.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cool and Blend:</b>Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool
            completely. Transfer everything (including any leftover liquid) to a
            blender jar and blend into a very smooth puree. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sauté the Onions: </b>In a separate pan or kadai, heat the oil
            and butter/ghee over medium heat. Add the bay leaf (if using) and
            then the finely chopped onions. Sauté until the onions are light
            golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cook the Paste:</b>Pour the blended tomato-cashew paste into the
            pan. Add the powdered spices (cumin, coriander, red chili,turmeric).
            Stir well and cook the masala on low heat, stirring occasionally,
            until the mixture thickens and you see oil/fat separating from the
            sides (about 10-15 minutes).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Simmer the Gravy:</b> Add about ¾ to 1 cup of water to achieve
            the desired gravy consistency and bring it to a simmer. Season with
            salt and sugar to balance the flavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Add Paneer and Finish:</b> Gently add the paneer cubes and the
            grated paneer to the gravy. Mix well. Crush the kasuri methi between
            your palms and sprinkle it in, along with the garam masala powder.
            Turn off the heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Final Touches:</b> Stir in the fresh cream and garnish with
            chopped coriander leaves. Cover and let it rest for 5 minutes for
            the paneer to absorb the flavors before serving.
